/* 
    WHAT IS TYPESCRIPT?

        - Typescript  was developed to bridge the gap between JS, which started out as a client side scripting language, and Object Oriented Programming Languages
        
        - Typescript is meant to bring tpye safety into JS. Types enable practices such a static-checking (checking that data types are correct) before run time

        - Typescript is a typed superset of JS that was created by Microsoft. It compiles to plain Js in any browser and has many syntactic similarities to JS, while also emulating traditional Object Oriented Programming Languages such as Java or C#

        - Anything that's part of JS is also part of Typescript

/*
    FEATURES OF TYPESCRIPT

        - Typescript code is converted to plain JS code
        - Javascript code is Typescript, and Typescript is JS
        - Typescript supports all JS libraries, including React
*/

/*
    DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TYPESCRIPT AND JS

        - Typescript is known as an Object Oriented Programming Language, whereas JS is just a scripting Language
        - Typescript has a feature known as static typing, or static checking, where JS does not
        - Typescript has interface
*/

/*
    ADVANTAGES OF TYPESCRIPT

        - Typescript always points out any errors at the time of development. This means less errors at run time
            - with compile time error checking, our program won't execute a single line of code until we remove all syntax errors
        - Static typing allows for checking type correctness at compile time, which is not available in plain JS
